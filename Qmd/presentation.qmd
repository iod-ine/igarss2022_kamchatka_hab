The full title of our paper is "Remote Sensing Evidence For The Harmful Algal Bloom Explanation Of The Ecological Situation In Kamchatka In Autumn Of 2020."
By itself, this is not a very interesting study.
We simply look at chlorophyll concentration anomaly time series over the east coast of Kamchatka peninsula for the dates of a suspected algal bloom event.
I think the approach we adopted is more interesting than the study itself. NEXT_SLIDE.
The study is very generic.
The main information source is the Sentinel-3 mission, specifically the Ocean and Land Color instrument.
One of its products is the estimated chlorophyll concentration in the water.
We recalculated these concentrations into a time-series of chlorophyll anomalies and used it to trace the suspected bloom in time.
I am sure most of you have seen many similar studies, so I will try not to focus on it too much.

The approach we took focuses on reproducibility. Almost every step of the study is automated using scripts.
I say almost because I don't think there is a way to automate the retrieval of long-term Sentinel-3 ocean data yet.
The EUMETSAT team is working on a new platform that will have an API, which would allow full end-to-end automation, but for now, the only way to access the data is to search through the archive manually.
The PDF of the paper and the HTML of this presentation are dynamic documents, meaning that they are generated from the results of the code automatically.
And, of course, all our code is open and available on GitHub.

# Part 1: The study

## Background

At the end of September of 2020 media widely reported an environmental disaster on the eastern coast of Kamchatka.

::: {.incremental}
* Massive die-off of marine life
* Poisoning symptoms in surfers
* Discoloration and foam formation
* Several expeditions on site
:::

. . .

All of theses can be explained by a *bloom of toxic algae*.
Can we additionally support that hypothesis with remote sensing data?

::: {.notes}
At the end of September -- beginning of October 2020, an environmental disaster was widely reported on the eastern coast of Kamchatka. NEXT_SLIDE
A storm washed many dead marine animals to the shore, which initiated an outcry over the media. NEXT_SLIDE
Reports of poisoning symptoms, skin and eye irritation from surfers in the area surfaced and added fuel to the growing public belief in some unspecified anthropogenic pollution. NEXT_SLIDE 
Photos of discolored water and foam along the coast circulated in social media. NEXT_SLIDE
Several expeditions were sent to the site to investigate, the most notable being the group of researchers from the Far Eastern Federal University.
They considered multiple possible explanations of the events, both technogenic and natural, and ultimately concluded that the most likely explanation NEXT_SLIDE is the bloom of toxic algae.
A harmful algal bloom would explain all observations.
We wanted to see if remote sensing data aligns with this hypothesis.

This is the map of the region of interest.
It's the southeast part of the Kamchatka peninsula.
The red dot marks the beach where surfers reported poisoning symptoms.
Along the coast of Avacha bay, many dead marine animals were washed onto the shore.

## Data

The primary data source was the **Sentinel-3** mission. 

* OLCI^[Ocean and Land Color Instrument] chl concentrations [300 m, 1.9 days]
* SLSTR^[Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer] sea surface temperature

. . . 

Where available, **Sentinel-2** MSI^[Multispectral instrument] data [10 m].
Processed using C2RCC^[Case 2 Regional Coast Color] in SNAP to extract chl concentrations. 

::: {.notes}
The primary data source for our analysis was the Sentinel-3 mission.
We worked with a time series of chlorophyll concentrations from 76 level 2 OLCI products covering June to November.
We also looked at sea surface temperatures from SLSTR products covering August to October 2017-2020 to check if there was a temperature anomaly compared to the previous years. NEXT_SLIDE
Where possible, we additionally looked at Sentinel-2 images, which offer much more detailed data with a spatial resolution of 10 meters, but a longer revisit period compared to Sentinel-3, making it much harder to find suitable images.
The total of 13 products were not covered by clouds, and we processed them with C2RCC to extract chlorophyll concentrations and produce atmospherically corrected true color images.
This is the same algorithm used in Sentinel-3.
:::

## Methods

**Relative chl anomaly**.
A reference concentration $\text{Chl-a}^{\text{ref}}$ for any given date is the median across the 61-day period ending 15 days before. 

$$
\Delta_r \text{Chl-a} = \frac{\text{Chl-a} - \text{Chl-a}^{\text{ref}}}{\text{Chl-a}^{\text{ref}}}.
$$

. . .

Visual analysis of the time-series of relative chl anomalies to trace the evolution of a suspected bloom in time.

::: {.notes}
To assess the presence of an algal bloom, we used relative chlorophyll anomaly maps to put observed concentrations into the context of average concentration over the recent past.
A reference concentration for any given date was calculated as a median across all images obtained in the 61-day period ending 15 days before.
We used a rolling window calculation, so each day had a unique reference. NEXT_SLIDE
Then we visually analyzed the time-series of relative anomaly maps to see if the chlorophyll concentrations follow the timeline of the events.

The evolution of the concentration anomaly does not contradict the timeline of the events.
:::

::: {.notes}
This is a representative subset of the anomaly map time-series.
Please ignore the pixelated high-value regions far away from the coast, they correspond to noisy predictions at the edges of clouds.
It starts in August, well before anything out of the ordinary was reported.
The coastal area has no deviation from the median.
The situation changes in the middle of September, where even though the values of relative anomalies are not large, over-concentration is noticeable along the whole coast.
The relative anomaly intensifies towards the end of September and the beginning of October.
Concentrations are significantly larger than the reference, and they stay at this level until the middle of October.
The situation becomes more stable only by the end of October, and by the beginning of November, there are again almost no deviations from the new reference, making the situation stable once again.
The timeline suggested by these results is consistent with the timeline of the events.
The first poisoning symptoms were reported as early as September 9th.
By September 29th, when the die-offs of marine animals were discovered, the bloom was in full force for a long time.
In the paper, we also show sea surface temperature maps, that show a change in temperatures that potentially could have triggered a bloom.

# Part 2: The approach

::: {.notes}
Now to what, I think, is a more interesting part of the presentation: the approach.
:::

## Literate programming

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Literate programming** is a paradigm in which natural language is mixed with snippets of code.

::: {.incremental}
* The results of code are rendered into the output document
* No copy-pasting of images, no chance to forget to update the report
* Every document comes with code that produced it
:::

::: {.notes}
Literate programming has been gaining traction recently.
It is a paradigm in which natural language is mixed with snippets of code.
It allows for generation of transparent and reproducible reports, papers, presentations and so on.
The screenshot on the right is a part of the source code of our paper.
You can see the text and the code to generate a map in the same document. NEXT_SLIDE
Compiling it will run the code and automatically generate an output of almost any format you can possibly need.
The paper, for example, is rendered to a LaTeX source document that is then compiled to a PDF.
This presentation is rendered to HTML and can be opened in any modern browser. NEXT_SLIDE
This removes the need to manually keep track of any computational output in the resulting documents.
If code changes, everything depending on it is updated right away. NEXT_SLIDE
And every document comes with the source code that produced it.
For example, if you liked any of the maps in the paper, you can open the repository and look at the code that generated it.
You don't need to manually implement the methods from their description because they come with the paper itself.

## Constituents

All the components all open source and free.

::: {.incremental}
* R and Python
* ESA GPT^[Graph Processing Tool] SNAP
* R Markdown and Quarto
* Git and GitHub

::: {.notes}
The components required to recreate our results or to create new results like ours are all open source and free. NEXT_SLIDE
We used a combination of Python and R scripts to automate the processing and generate all maps.
You don't have to use both at the same time, you can use one language you are more comfortable with. NEXT_SLIDE
To process the Sentinel imagery, we used SNAP.
More specifically, we added a Python wrapper around SNAP graph processing tool to run the computations on a headless workstation using a simple Python script. NEXT_SLIDE
And to generate the output, we used R Markdown and its more recent successor, Quarto.
These are literate programming frameworks. NEXT_SLIDE
To version control and openly host the code, we used Git and GitHub.
It's even possible to host the web versions of the papers and presentations directly from GitHub for free. NEXT_SLIDE
I invite you to take a look at the repository.

How to automate the data retrieval?
:::

::: {.notes}
To chain all the processing steps together, we used an R package called "targets".
This slide shows the network of processing steps, annotated with the time it took to run.
All the heavy lifting of processing the imagery is done by SNAP.
The only not automated step right now is the retrieval of long-term archive Sentinel-3 ocean data.
As I said in the beginning, the EUMETSAT team is working on a solution that will have an API, so the full lifecycle of studies like ours can be automated.
And imagine all papers come in that format, where you can recreate, reuse and tinker with the code to verify and build on the results.
:::

## How to recreate the results

. . .

Run the pipeline:

```r
targets::tar_make()
```

. . .

Compile the paper pdf:

```r
knitr::knit("Rnw/index.RRnw")
```

Generate the presentation html:

```shell
quarto render Qmd/presentation.qmd
```

::: {.notes}
If you were interested in recreating our results, everything comes down to three steps. NEXT_SLIDE
The first is to actually run the processing pipeline.
This will execute the graph from the previous slide and start tracking which tasks have been updated and need to be rerun in case you decide to change something in the code. NEXT_SLIDE
And to generate the paper PDF or the presentation HTML, you run a respective command either in R console or in the terminal.
All steps can, if needed, be reduced to one step by adding the compilation of output as the last step of the processing pipeline.
We just chose to separate them.
The only assumption here is that you somehow managed to get the same Sentinel-3 ocean long-term archive data and placed it in the project folder.

## Conclusions

Two parts of the presentation, two sets of conclusions.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### The study
* Supports the HAB^[Harmful Algal Bloom] hypothesis
* Explains the timeline
* No *in situ* data
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
### The approach
* Valid for studies like this
* Open, easy to use and well-documented tools
* We should strive for more reproducibility
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
To conclude the study part of the presentation, we aimed to establish whether remote sensing aligns with the harmful algal bloom explanation of the ecological situation in Kamchatka.
The results are indeed consistent with the presence of a bloom of algae, and the timelines are aligned.
Since we don't have any in situ data, we can't actually be 100% sure.
But combined with the reports of the Far Eastern Federal University, a bloom is the only plausible explanation.
In terms of the approach, the conclusion is that it is very much possible to conduct studies like these in the reproducible research framework.
There is a lot of open-source, free, easy to use and well-documented related tools.
The world where most of the published studies are completely reproducible is a good place.
